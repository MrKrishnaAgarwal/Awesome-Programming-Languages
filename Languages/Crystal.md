# Crystal
- **Description** - Crystal is a programming language with the following goals:
Have a syntax similar to Ruby (but compatibility with it is not a goal)
Statically type-checked but without having to specify the type of variables or method arguments.
Be able to call C code by writing bindings to it in Crystal.
Have compile-time evaluation and generation of code, to avoid boilerplate code.
Compile to efficient native code.
